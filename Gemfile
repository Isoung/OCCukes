# Include a Gemfile for the sake of Bundler. You might want to run a
# specific version of Cucumber, or run Cucumber within some IDE tool
# (e.g. RubyMine) that automatically wraps the Gem execution
# environment using Bundler, a good thing.
gem 'cucumber'

# Add RSpec to the bundle. Without this specific inclusion, you cannot
# run Cucumber from TextMate without error. TextMate looks for the
# Gemfile and runs Cucumber and RSpec within the bundled environment.
gem 'rspec'
